WIP, unbalanced ternary machine 

Roadmap

- [ ] Mathematics operations

- [ ] Bit packing and optimizations

- [ ] Less type conversions (more raw ternary logic)

- [ ] Signed ternary values

- [ ] IEEE floating point-like ternary numbers

- [ ] Proper wraparound logic for overflows

- [ ] Checked math logic to detect overflows
